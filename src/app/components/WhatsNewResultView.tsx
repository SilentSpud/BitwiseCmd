          <p>Behold! After a long time of inactivity, BitwiseCmd is getting an update. Here is what changed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Browser's JavaScript engine is no longer used for the execution of bitwise operations. BitwiseCmd has its own shiny custom-built bitwise calculator that supports operations integer of different sizes (8,16,32, and 64 bits) as well as their signed and unsigned versions. <CommandLink text="Check it out!" command="-1b 255ub -1 4294967295u -1l 18446744073709551615u" />. This calculator tries to follow the same behavior of bitwise operations as implemented in C. This includes shifting an integer by the number of bytes equal to its size (spoiler: you get the same number, this is undefined behavior in C. Don't believe me? Check this <a href="https://codeyarns.com/tech/2004-12-20-c-shift-operator-mayhem.html#gsc.tab=0">link</a>
              ).
            </li>
            <li>A slightly improved UI</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I'm sure there will be some bugs following such a big update. I will do my best to fix them as they are found.</p>
          <p>Many thanks to all people that submitted issues on GitHub. Your feedback is greatly appreciated. </p>
